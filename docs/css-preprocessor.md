# CSS Preprocessor

CSS preprocessors make it easy to automate repetitive tasks, reduce the number of errors and code bloat, create reusable code snippets, and ensure backward compatibility.

## [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

SASS is a CSS preprocessor compatible with all versions of CSS. It is therefore a tool used by web developers to translate non-standard stylesheet code into standard CSS code, readable by most browsers.

```bash
npm install -g sass
```
