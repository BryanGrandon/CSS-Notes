## [Pseudo-classes](/code/pseudo-classes.css)

A CSS pseudo class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the selected element.

- `:hover` Allows you to apply a style when hovering over an element.
- `:active` Allows to apply a style when the element is activated.
- `:visited` Styles are applied once the link has been visited by the user.
- `:link` The styles are applied to the link that has not yet been visited.
