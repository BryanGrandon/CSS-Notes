# Length

## _Absolute length units_

Absolute units of measurement in CSS refer to units that do not change, those that are the same in all context.

- Inches: `in`
- Centimeters: `cm`
- Picas: `pc`
- Millimeters: `mm`
- Points: `pt`
- Pixels `px`
- Quarter-millimeters: `q`

## _Relative length units_

The units of measurement in relative CSS depend on the element or factor to which they refer.

- `em`: Font-size of the element.
- `rem`: Font-size of the root element.
- `vw`: 1% of the viewport's width.
- `vh`: 1% of the viewport's height.
- `%`: Percentage relative to the parent element.
