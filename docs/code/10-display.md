# Display

The CSS display property specifies whether an element is treated as a block or inline element.

- `block`: Makes the behavior of the element like a block.
- `inline`: The element will be rendered in line with other elements.
- `inline-block`: The element will have a mixed behavior between the two previous ones.
- `none`: Hides an element, so it will not take up any space.
