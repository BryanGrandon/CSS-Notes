# [Pseudo-element](/code/pseudo-element.css)

Pseudo-elements are added to the selectors, but they do not describe a special state, but allow you to add styles to a specific part of the document.

- `::after` allows us to add a cosmetic content after the element using the `content` property.
- `::before` allows us to add a cosmetic content before the element using the `content` property.
- `::first-letter` Applies styles to the first letter of the content.
- `::first-line` Apply styles to the first line of content.
- `::selection` Applies styles to the part of a document that has been highlighted by the user.
- `::placeholder` represents the temporary text in an `<input>` element or a `<textarea>` element.
