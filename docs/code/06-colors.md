| Keyword             | Colors in HTML are represented by names instead of numbers. Currently 140 color names are available that can be supported by existing browsers.                                         |
| Hexadecimal         | Hexadecimal color codes consist of a # sign and three pairs of characters representing the intensity of the three primary colors (red, green and blue). Values can range from 00 to FF. |
| RGB                 | RGB color codes are composed of three numbers separated by commas. Each represents the intensity of the primary colors by an integer on a scale from 0 to 255.                          |
| HSL                 | The main difference between HSL and RGB is that the values represent hue, saturation and lightness. Hue is measured on a scale that ranges from 0 to 360                                |
| Alpha               | The alpha parameter allows the color to have transparency. The values range from 0.0 (totally transparent) to 1.0 (totally opaque).                                                     |
